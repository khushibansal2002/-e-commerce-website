            <p>The purpose of this website is to develop an efficient and convenient system for buying and selling second hand products.

At present, when seniors want to sell or donate their books or any hostel utilities to their juniors, they don’t have proper platform to connect with their juniors and juniors also have to search for second hand books and other stuff. In Banasthali mainly this problem is faced by newcomers or 1st year students who don’t have proper idea of what all is required for hostel . </p>
